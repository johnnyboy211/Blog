            The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the
            city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest
            ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing
            amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under
            the emperor Vespasian in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his
            successor and heir, Titus. Further modifications were made during
            the reign of Domitian. The three emperors who were patrons of the
            work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was
            named the Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and
            archaeologists for its association with their family name.

            Kerala is a state on the Malabar Coast of India. It was formed on 1
            November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation
            Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile
            regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore. Spread
            over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 21st largest Indian
            state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and
            northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea
            to the west. With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census,
            Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. It is divided
            into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram.
            Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the
            official language of the state.

            While it may not be as flashy, refined, or impressive as the rest of
            the films in the franchise, Sorcerer’s Stone (or Philosopher’s Stone
            for the Potter purists) deserves immense credit for setting up this
            series so wonderfully, and laying a fantastic foundation off of
            which the other films could be built. Director Chris Columbus was
            not only responsible for putting together the incredible cast, but
            he also captured Rowling’s wizarding world on film in a manner that
            felt relatable and wholly transfixing. Sorcerer’s Stone is told
            through the eyes of an 11-year-old, and so the film was always going
            to skew a bit younger than subsequent installments, but Columbus
            refuses to talk down to his audience and wisely sidesteps delving
            into cartoony kids’ movie land. <br />
            <br />
            And even though it’s tonally the lightest film of the bunch,
            Sorcerer’s Stone still works wonderfully as a fantastic entry in the
            Potter franchise. The winning combination of charm and smarts
            permeates throughout, and Columbus nails the founding friendship of
            our three heroes, culminating in a grand finale that lets each one
            of them shine. Who can resist adorable Ron Weasley commanding a
            giant chess set with gusto as he sits atop a stone knight?

            Not as good as Infinity war pacing-wise, but is a satisfying ending
            to the saga. High production quality, and a great soundtrack like
            its predecessor. The final fight did feel a little cliché (two
            armies brainlessly charging at each other for a typical smackdown).
            Not much to write about, it made every marvel movie before it worth
            the ticket.

          Hi I'm Jonathan Mathew and I'm 12 years old. I really like programming
          and I'm studying coding with Byju's Future School. I'm also learning
          piano and I'm Grade 4. I'm also learning 3D modelling and I've started
          a project on that. I really like to be creative sometimes with
          painting and making music but I also like maths and computer science
          to balance out the creativity with logic. It's nice to take a break
          from stuff and experience new things.
